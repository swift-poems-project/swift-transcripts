XII. p. 233.), and challenging Dr. <hi rend="underline">Helsham</hi> to exceed him by returning fourteen more (thirty-four in all); which Dr. <hi rend="underline">Helsham</hi> accordingly here performs. ────These are some of the puerilities for which the Dean has since been severly censured; but the foioles of such a writer as Dr. <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi> are amusing, even in the few instances where they are void of instruction.</note>.</title>
