The provocation given to Dean Percival was a reflection upon his pedantry and his wife's housewifery. Swift says, “Dean Percival has answered the other Dean's Journal in Grub-street, justly taxing him for avarice and want of hospitality. Madam Percival absolutely denies all the facts; insists that she never made candles of dripping; that Charley never had the chincough, &amp;c.”──Vol. XVI. p. 419. The first part of Percival's verses allude to the housekeeping at the deanery while Sterne held that preferment:──</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="2" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-headnote-2"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-headnote-2-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-headnote-2-line-group-1-line-1"/></lg></head><head type="note" n="3" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-headnote-3"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-headnote-3-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-headnote-3-line-group-1-line-1"/></lg></head>

in:</l><l n="3" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-3"> The house is large, and to adorn her,</l><l n="4" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-4"> From garret down to chimney corner,</l><l n="5" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-5"> The upper chambers were well lined</l><l n="6" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-6"> With antique books and books new coined;</l><l n="7" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-7"> Which plainly shewed its founder's head</l><l n="8" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-8"> With learning of all sorts supplied.</l><l n="9" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-9"> The house on every part was stored</l><l n="10" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-10"> To entertain the greatest lord;</l><l n="11" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-11"> Nor did the poorest meet disdain,</l><l n="12" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-12"> But fill'd his belly with his brain.</l><l n="13" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-13"> The kitchen grates, like Vesta's altar,</l><l n="14" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-14"> Had fire in't whene'er you call, sir.</l><l n="15" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-15"> There were appointed vestal dames</l><l n="16" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-16"> To stir up the devouring flames.</l><l n="17" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-17"> On these were laid fat pigs and geese,</l><l n="18" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-18"> All beasts and fowls for sacrifice.</l><l n="19" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-19"> The sea itself could not escape,</l><l n="20" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-20"> For fish of all sorts here would gape,</l><l n="21" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-21"> And bleed, soals, salmons, lobsters, cods,</l><l n="22" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-22"> To gratify the hungry gods;</l><l n="23" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-23"> And to drive off the mind's dejection</l><l n="24" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-24"> Wit flew about, but no reflection;</l><l n="25" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-25"> To keep the spirits in vibration,</l><l n="26" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-26"> Wine joined

xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-29"> He loved his chapter, treated all</l><l n="30" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-30"> His dignitaries, vicars chorall,</l><l n="31" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-31"> From Tallboy down to little Worrall.</l><l n="32" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-32"> In short he lived, and that's what few can</l><l n="33" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-33"> Justly report of Swift our new Dean.</l><l n="34" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-34"> He sometimes to a chapter goes</l><l n="35" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-35"> With saucy strut and turn'd-up nose,</l><l n="36" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-36"> Leans on his cushion, then he'll bid ye,</l><l n="37" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-37"> Hearken to what all know already.</l><l n="38" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-38"> Perhaps he'll sneer or break a jest,</l><l n="39" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-39"> But de'il a bit to break your fast.</l><l n="40" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-40"> Go when you please, let the clock strike</l><l n="41" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-41"> What hour it will, 'tis all alike.</l><l n="42" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-42"> Some country Preb. comes just at one</l><l n="43" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-43"> In hopes to dine, and so be gone.</l><l n="44" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-44"> The Dean appears:──“I'm glad to see you,</l><l n="45" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-45"> Pray tell what service I can do you.</l><l n="46" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-46"> Be quick, for I am going out.”</l><l n="47" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-47"> The hungry Levite's vexed no doubt,</l><l n="48" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-48"> To be thus baulked; tucks up his gown,</l><l n="49" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-49"> Makes a low scrape, and so to town:</l><l n="50" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-50"> Is welcome there, so makes a shift</l><l n="51" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-51"> To drink a glass and rail at Swift.</l><l n="52" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-52"> But of this farce you'll know the reason,</l><l n="53" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-53"> You shall, I'm sure it can't be treason.</l><l n="54" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-54"> He dines abroad you think──mistaken,</l><l n="55" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-55"> He dines at home on sprouts and bacon.</l><l n="56" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-56"> Besides, his two chief slaves are missing,</l><l n="57" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-57"> To boil his drink and broil his grisking,</l><l n="58" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-58"> Pert Jack and Robin, I mean Grattan,</l><l n="59" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-59"> As suppliant slaves as e'er had hat on;</l><l n="60" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-60"> Such slaves as these you know delights him,</l><l n="61" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-61"> Who're sure to trudge when he invites 'em</l><l n="62" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-62"> And that's as often as in his kitchen,</l><l n="63" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-63"> A fire is made to broil a pigeon.</l><l n="64" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-64"> The seventeenth of March each year,</l><l n="65" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-65"> The chapter meets to make good cheer.</l><l n="66" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-66"> The Dean's allowed five pounds or more,</l><l n="67" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-67"> To entertain about half a score.</l><l n="68" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-68"> You're sure to meet a handsome dish,</l><l n="69" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-69"> Of salmon, or some other fish;</l><l n="70" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-70"> A dish of sup, a leg of mutton,</l><l n="71" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-71"> By servants are the table put on;</l><l n="72" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-72"> A plate with puddings then next comes,</l><l n="73" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-73"> One plain, one almond, t'other plumbs:</l><l n="74" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-74"> The second course adorns the table,</l><l n="75" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-75"> With loin of beef most formidable;</l><l n="76" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-76"> A sallad, with a dish of fowl,</l><l n="77" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-77"> Of this huge treat makes up the whole.</l><l n="78" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-78"> Now if some critic should accost him,</l><l n="79" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-79"> And ask how much this dinner cost him,</l><l n="80" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-80"> He could not say that he had lost,</l><l n="81" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-81"> Any great matter by the roast;</l><l n="82" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-82"> The treat, just as the Dean bespoke it,</l><l n="83" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-83"> Put two pound ten into his pocket,</l><l n="84" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-84"> Besides, the fragments of the feast</l><l n="85" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-85"> Will feed his house a week at least.</l><l n="86" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-86"> As for himself, with draggled gown,</l><l n="87" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-87"> Poor curate-like he'll trudge the town,</l><l n="88" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-88"> To eat a meal with punster base,</l><l n="89" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-89"> Or buffoon call him if you please.</l><l n="90" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-90"> Sometimes to Gallstown he will go,</l><l n="91" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-91"> To spend a month or two, or so,</l><l n="92" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-92"> Admires the baron, George and's spouse,</l><l n="93" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-93"> Lives well, and then lampoons the house.</l><l n="94" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-94"> Thus far our bard in doggrel rhyme,</l><l n="95" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-95"> In the Dean's kitchen, spent his time;</l><l n="96" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-96"> He's dull, because there is no fire,</l><l n="97" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-97"> Or wine his rustic muse t'inspire.</l><l n="98" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-98"> But let's proceed from these poor tricks,</l><l n="99" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-99"> O' th' kitchen to his politicks.<gap/><gap/></l><l n="100" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-100"> They stare, and thinks he knows as well,</l><l n="101" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-101"> All depths of state as Macchiavel.</l><l n="102" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-102"> It must be so, since from him flows,</l><l n="103" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-103"> Whate'er the earl of Oxford knows.</l><l n="104" xml:id="spp-M60501W1-line-104"> He swears the project of the
