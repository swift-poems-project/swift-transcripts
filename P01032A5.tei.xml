It is also believed, that he hath composed others occasionally, for the Amusement of himself and a few intimate Friends; which by the Indiscretion of others, were, from stolen and uncorrect Copies, <hi rend="underline">dragged into Light</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="5" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-5"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-5-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-5-line-group-1-line-1">But, I hold it for certain, that a much greater Number have, by the Boldness of <hi rend="underline">Printers</hi>, and the Want of Judgment in <hi rend="underline">Readers</hi>, been charged upon that <hi rend="underline">Author</hi>, wherein he never had the smallest Finger, as I am assured he hath often declared; and which is remarkable, was as free in disowning some Writings charged upon him, of which he had no Reason to be ashamed, as he could be of the meanest Productions of <hi rend="underline">Hibernian Grub-street</hi>: Of which I shall instance only one Pamphlet, which hath been very well received, as it justly deserved. It is entitled, <hi rend="underline">An infallible Scheme to pay the Nation's Debts, by a Tax upon Vice</hi>; which he disclaimed any Share in, at the same Time giving it due Praises. And, I find, the <hi rend="underline">true Author</hi> of that Pamphlet lies yet conceal'd; which is a Happiness that few <hi rend="underline">Writers</hi> of any Distinction can arrive at, whether by their own Indiscretion, or that of their Friends, I shall not determine.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="6" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-6"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-6-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-6-line-group-1-line-1">As to those <hi rend="underline">fatal Verses</hi> called the <hi rend="underline">Lady's Dressing Room</hi>, which have so highly inflamed the whole Sex (except a very few of better Judgment) as I can by no Means justify the vulgar Opinion, that seems to fix it upon a Person, so well known for Works of a very different Nature; so I cannot but lament the prevailing ill Taste among us, which is not able to discover that useful Satyr running through every Line, and the Matter as decently wrapp'd up, as it is possible the Subject could bear.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="7" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-7"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-7-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-7-line-group-1-line-1"><hi rend="underline">Cleanliness</hi> hath, in all polite Ages and Nations, been esteemed the chief corporeal Perfection in <hi rend="underline">Women</hi>, as it is well known to those who are conversant with the antient <hi rend="underline">Poets</hi>. And so it is still among the young People of Judgment and Sobriety, when they are disposed to marry. And I do not doubt, but that there is a great Number of young Ladies in this Town and Kingdom, who in reading that Poem, find great Complacency in their own Minds, from a Consciousness that the Satyrical Part in the <hi rend="underline">Lady's Dressing-Room</hi>, does not in the least affect them.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="8" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-8"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-8-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-8-line-group-1-line-1">Wherefore it is manifest, that no <hi rend="underline">Poem</hi> was ever written with a better Design for the Service of the <hi rend="underline">Sex</hi>: Wherein our <hi rend="underline">Author</hi> hath observed to a Tittle, the Precepts of his Master <hi rend="underline">Horace</hi>; or, indeed, rather hath gone very far beyond him, in the Article of <hi rend="underline">Decency</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="9" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-9"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-9-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-9-line-group-1-line-1">That great <hi rend="underline">Poet</hi>, instructing us what Actions are fittest to be produced openly upon the <hi rend="underline">Scene</hi>, and which are most proper to be only related to the Audience, goes many Lengths beyond the <hi rend="underline">Author</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">Lady's Dressing-Room</hi>; for at the same Instant when he says, some Actions should not appear as done upon the Stage, he allows they may be <hi rend="underline">recited</hi> with <hi rend="underline">Pleasure</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Elegance</hi>; and yet when he comes to Particulars, his Recital is extremely gross, and so are his very <hi rend="underline">Precepts</hi> which forbid the Actions: That if our infinitely more modest <hi rend="underline">Author</hi> had imitated his <hi rend="underline">Master's Style</hi>, the whole World might with great Appearance of Reason, have been up in Arms against him.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="10" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-10"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-10-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-10-line-group-1-line-1">Therefore, to set these two <hi rend="underline">Poets</hi> in a true Light, I have ventured, for the Satisfaction of both Sexes, to translate, as Literally as I could, ten Lines in <hi rend="underline">Horace</hi>, upon the very same Subject, which our <hi rend="underline">Author</hi> hath handled with a Decency so far superior to his <hi rend="underline">Roman</hi> Master.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="11" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-11"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-11-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-11-line-group-1-line-1">To justify the Truth of my Translation, I desire all fine Gentlemen and Ladies will appeal from me to the Information of the Learned, that I may be wholly clear from the least Censure of misrepresenting so great an Authority; for, indeed, if I have been guilty of any Fault, it is in palliating the gross Expressions in the Original, and softning them very much to the <hi rend="underline">Politeness</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">present Age</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="12" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-12"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-12-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01032A5-headnote-12-line-group-1-line-1">The <hi rend="underline">Latin</hi> is Word for Word as follows:<lb/><hi rend="underline">Aut agitur res in scenis, aut acta refertur.Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,Quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, &amp; quæIpse sibi tradit spectator.
