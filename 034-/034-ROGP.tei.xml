night, and are its light by day:First of God's darling attributes,Thou daily seest Him face to face,</l><l n="5" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-5"> Nor does thy essence fixed depend on giddy circumstanceOf time or place,</l><l n="6" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-6"> Two foolish guides in every sublunary dance:How shall we find thee then in dark disputes?How shall we search thee in a battle gained,Or a weak argument by force maintained?</l><l n="7" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-7"> In dagger-contests, and the artillery of words,</l><l n="8" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-8"> (For swords are madmen's tongues, and

dusky shade,</l><l n="14" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-14"> By dark reverted rays from its reflection made;Whence the weak shapes wild and imperfect pass,</l><l n="15" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-15"> Like sunbeams shot at too far distance from a glass;Which all the mimic forms express,</l><l n="16" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-16"> Though in strange uncouth postures, and uncomely dress;So when Cartesian artists tryTo solve appearances of sightIn its reception to the eye,</l><l n="17" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-17"> And catch the living landscape through a scanty light,The figures all inverted show,And colours of a faded hue;</l><l n="18" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-18"> Here a pale shape with upward footstep treads,And men seem walking on their heads;There whole herds suspended lieReady to tumble down into the sky;Such are the ways ill-guided mortals goTo judge of things above by things below.</l><l n="19" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-19"> Disjointing shapes as in the fairy-land of dreams,Or images that sink in streams;No wonder, then, we talk amissOf truth, and what, or where it is:Say muse, for thou, if any, know'st</l><l n="20" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-20"> Since the bright essence

balance, false and light,Following opinion, dark, and blind,That vagrant leader of the mind,</l><l n="26" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-26"> Till Honesty and Conscience are clear out of sight.</l></lg><lg

xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-29"> Pleased with an empty swelling to be counted great;</l><l n="30" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-30"> Make their minds travel o'er infinity of space,Rapt through the wide expanse of thought,And oft in contradiction's vortex caught,</l><l n="31" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-31"> To keep that worthless clod, the body, in one place:</l><l n="32" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-32"> Errors like this did old astronomers misguide,</l><l n="33" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-33"> Led blindly on by gross philosophy and pride,Who, like hard masters, taught the sunThrough many a needless sphere to run,</l><l n="34" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-34"> Many an eccentric and unthrifty motion make,And thousand incoherent journeys take,Whilst all the advantage by it got,Was but to light earth's inconsiderable spot.</l><l n="35" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-35"> The herd beneath, who see the weathercock of stateHung loosely on the church's pinnacle,</l><l n="36" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-36"> Believe it firm, because perhaps the day is mild and still;</l><l n="37" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-37"> But when they find it turn with the first blast of fate,By gazing upwards giddy grow,And think the church itself does so;Thus fools, for being strong and numerous grown,Suppose the truth, like all the world, their own;</l><l n="38" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-38"> And holy S<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">ANCROFT</hi>'S motion quite irregular appears,Because 'tis opposite to theirs.</l></lg><lg n="9" type="stanza"><l n="39" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-39">V</l></lg><lg n="10" type="stanza"><l n="40" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-40">In vain then would the muse the multitude advise,&#13;Whose peevish knowledge thus perversely liesIn gathering follies from the wise;Rather put on thy anger and thy spite,And some kind power for once dispenseThrough the dark mass, the dawn of so much sense,</l><l n="41" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-41"> To make them understand, and feel me when I write;The muse and I no more revenge desire,</l><l n="42" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-42"> Each line shall stab, shall blast, like daggers and like fire;Ah, Britain, land of angels! which of all thy sins,(Say, hapless isle, althoughIt is a bloody list we know)Has given thee up a dwelling-place to fiends?Sin and the plague ever abound</l><l n="43" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-43"> In governments too easy, and too fruitful ground;Evils which a too gentle king,Too flourishing a spring,And too warm summers bring:Our British soil is over-rank, and breeds</l><l n="44" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-44"> Among the noblest flowers a thousand poisonous weeds,And every stinking weed so lofty grows,As if 'twould overshade the royal rose,The royal rose the glory of our morn,But, ah, too much without a thorn.</l></lg><lg n="11" type="stanza"><l n="45" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-45">VI</l></lg><lg n="12" type="stanza"><l n="46" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-46">Forgive (original mildness) this ill-governed zeal,&#13;'Tis all the angry slighted muse can doIn the pollution of these days;No province now is left her but to rail,</l><l n="47" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-47"> And poetry has lost the art to praise,Alas, the occasions are so few:None e'er but you,And your almighty master, knewWith heavenly peace of mind to bear</l><l n="48" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-48"> (Free from our tyrant-passions, anger, scorn, or fear)The giddy turns of popular rage,</l><l n="49" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-49"> And all the contradictions of a poisoned age;The Son of God pronounced by the same breathWhich straight pronounced his death;And though I should but ill be understoodIn wholly equalling our sin and theirs,And measuring by the scanty thread of witWhat we call holy, and great, and just, and good,</l><l n="50" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-50"> (Methods in talk whereof our pride and ignorance makes us use)And which our wild ambition foolishly comparesWith endless and with infinite;Yet pardon, native Albion, when I say</l><l n="51" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-51"> Among thy stubborn sons there haunts that spirit of Jews,That those forsaken wretches who todayRevile His great ambassador,Seem to discover what they would have done(Were his humanity on earth once more)</l><l n="52" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-52"> To his undoubted master, heaven's almighty

wondrous proud,&#13;Though very turbulent and very loud;The crazy composition shows,</l><l n="55" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-55"> Like that fantastic medley in the idol's toes,Made up of iron mixed with clay,This, crumbles into dust,That, moulders into rust,Or melts by the first shower away.</l><l n="56" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-56"> Nothing is fixed that mortals see or know,</l><l n="57" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-57"> Unless, perhaps, some stars above be so;And those, alas, do show</l><l n="58" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-58"> Like all transcendent excellence below;In both, false mediums cheat our sight,</l><l n="59" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-59"> And far exalted objects lessen by their height:Thus, primitive S<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">ANCROFT</hi> moves too highTo be observed by vulgar eye,And rolls the silent yearOn his own secret regular sphere,</l><l n="60" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-60"> And sheds, though all unseen, his sacred influence here.</l></lg><lg n="15"

from thy private peaceful orb appear;For, sure, we want some guide from heaven to showThe way which every wandering fool belowPretends so perfectly to know;And which for aught I see, and much I fear,The world has wholly missed;I mean, the way which leads to Christ:</l><l n="63" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-63"> Mistaken idiots! see how giddily they run,Led blindly on by avarice and pride,What mighty numbers follow them;Each fond of erring with his guide:Some whom ambition drives, seek heaven's high sonIn Caesar's court, or in Jerusalem;Others, ignorantly wise,</l><l n="64" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-64"> Among proud doctors and disputing pharisees:</l><l n="65" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-65"> What could the sages gain but unbelieving scorn;Their faith was so uncourtly when they said</l><l n="66" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-66"> That heaven's high son was in a village born;That the world's saviour had beenIn a vile manger laid,And fostered in a wretched

last?</l><l n="70" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-70"> And yet the world, whose eyes are on our mighty prince,Thinks heaven has cancelled all our sins,</l><l n="71" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-71"> And that

draw more examples than the good;And divine S<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">ANCROFT</hi>, weary with the weight</l><l n="74" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-74"> Of a declining church, by faction her worse foe

present mitre, as that fearful storm of late,Which in its dusky march along the plain,Swept up whole churches as it list,Wrapped in a whirlwind and a mist;</l><l n="78" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-78"> Like that prophetic tempest in the virgin reign,And swallowed them at last, or flung them down.Such were the storms good S<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">ANCROFT</hi> long has borne;The mitre, which his sacred head has worn,Was, like his master's crown, enwreathed with thorn.Death's sting is swallowed up in victory at last,The bitter cup is from him passed:Fortune in both extremes,Though blasts from contrariety of winds,Yet to firm heavenly minds,Is but one thing under two different names;</l><l n="79" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-79"> And even the sharpest eye that has the prospect seen,Confesses ignorance to judge between;</l><l n="80" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-80"> And must, to human reasoning opposite, conclude</l><l n="81" xml:id="spp-034-ROGP-line-81"> To point out which is moderation,
