(See his Select Collection of Poems, 1778.) In its structure of verse, and turn of thought, there is an obvious imitation of Dryden's Eulogy upon Oliver Cromwell. This, among other circumstances, shews, that the taste of Swift's youth, was formed not upon the better compositions of the end of the seventeenth century, but upon those which had been fashionable in the beginning of Charles II.'s reign. This he probably owed to his residence with Temple.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="2" xml:id="spp-011-14W2-headnote-2"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-011-14W2-headnote-2-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-011-14W2-headnote-2-line-group-1-line-1"/></lg></head><head type="note" n="3" xml:id="spp-011-14W2-headnote-3"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-011-14W2-headnote-3-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-011-14W2-headnote-3-line-group-1-line-1"/></lg></head>
