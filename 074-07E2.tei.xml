The several characters which make up this little group, are the Earl and Countess of Berkeley, Mrs Biddy Floyd, Mrs Herries, Mrs Weston, and Dr Swift. This ballad appears to have been designed as a piece of raillery upon the whole set, and written purely for their domestic entertainment. This poem, so far as it runs, is full of mirth and humour; the second stanza in particular is wonderfully striking, <lb/><hi rend="underline">But then his Honour cry'd</hi>, &amp;c. _The surprise of my Lord Berkeley, and the bringing Jack How to remembrance upon the sight of a knave, for no other reason than because he was a famous anti-courtier in those times, perpetually opposing and thwarting the measures of K. William in the house of Commons, is a whimsical piece of drollery in the poetic strain, especially when addressed to a court-lord in one of the highest employments. We are at a loss to know whether any more characters were designed to have been introduced into this ballad; but we may reasonably suppose there were, because in reality it seemeth to have been broken off in the very midst of its career. However, indeed, the politeness of Dr Swift would not suffer him to enlarge or correct it, after my Lady Betty Berkeley had in a manner given it the finishing stroke; on occasion of which he writ the <hi rend="underline">Ballad to the tune of the cutpurse</hi>, [vol. 6. p. 71.], which hath abundance of life, humour, pleasantry, and politeness. <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi>.</note>.</title>
