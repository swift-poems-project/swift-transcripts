Wit,</l><l n="8" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-8"> In Complements such as AUGUSTUS might fit,</l><l n="9" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-9"> Tho' what he has said of his Patron is faint,</l><l n="10" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-10"> Nor wonder, since no Man his Virtues can paint;</l><l n="11" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-11"> For no Poet ever attempts to express</l><l n="12"

xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-29"> Observe with what Judgment he shews this our Isle,</l><l n="30" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-30"> A Patron so artful our Cares can beguile;</l><l n="31" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-31"> How that very peevish, cross Grumbler the Dean,</l><l n="32" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-32"> Does nothing at Court but of Courtiers complain,</l><l n="33" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-33"> Such Impudence 'tis, in a Man of his Station,</l><l n="34" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-34"> To put in one Word for the Good of the Nation,</l><l n="35" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-35"> That he with Submission sits silently List'ning,</l><l n="36" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-36"> Like a Clerk when the Person holds forth at a Christ'ning;</l><l n="37"

xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-43"> My Lord, what I tell you is true to a Tittle,</l><l n="44" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-44"> Or may I be banish'd from licking your Spittle.</l><l n="45" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-45"> Why then, quoth my Lord, since you give me this Trouble,</l><l n="46" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-46"> I tell you, in short, you are ev'ry Way double</l><l n="47" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-47"> As Poet, as Doctor, as Rector, as Vicar;</l><l n="48" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-48"> As Dealer, as Builder, as Planter, as quicker.</l><l n="49" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-49"> But if you've a mind to be tripple, rely on,</l><l n="50" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-50"> My Word, and I'll make you a second <hi rend="underline">Geryon</hi>.</l><l n="51" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-51"> Ye Critick malicious, now read what he says,</l><l n="52" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-52"> In those matchless Verses on <hi rend="underline">Fermanagh Ways</hi>,</l><l n="53" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-53"> Where all the rough Pebbles are polish'd so fine,</l><l n="54" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-54"> Like Emralds they sparkle, like Diamonds they shine;</l><l n="55" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-55"> Whoever hereafter that fall on these Stones,</l><l n="56" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-56"> Shall think it an Honour to break half his Bones;</l><l n="57" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-57"> Now see the Fineness of a true Politician,</l><l n="58" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-58"> He'd change for the worse, and he'd thrash like a Priscian,</l><l n="59" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-59"> From thumping the Cushion to wake those that nod,</l><l n="60" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-60"> Instead of a Sermon he'd brandish a Rod.</l><l n="61" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-61"> But <hi rend="underline">Charly</hi> (tho' <hi rend="underline">Charly</hi>) is not such a Tool,</l><l n="62" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-62"> To change for more Trouble a Sine-cure School.</l><l n="63" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-63"> Four Hundred <hi rend="underline">per Annum</hi>, not one Shilling under,</l><l n="64" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-64"> To preach in two Churches twelve long Miles asunder.</l><l n="65" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-65"> And wade it a Horseback in Dirt to the Knee,</l><l n="66" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-66"> When <hi rend="underline">Paddy</hi> can better wade thro' it than he.</l><l n="67" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-67"> Observe his Address, with what artful Submission,</l><l n="68" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-68"> He tells his rich Patron, his grievous Condition.</l><l n="69" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-69"> Quite ruin'd, and Bankrupt, reduc'd to a Farthing,</l><l n="70" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-70"> By making too much of a very small Garden,</l><l n="71" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-71"> By squand'ring his Money in Dribs to the Poor,</l><l n="72" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-72"> He's ready to leave the Key under the Door,</l><l n="73" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-73"> And grieves that his Patron has so much to give,</l><l n="74" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-74"> While he (more's the Pity, is shifting to live.)</l><l n="75" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-75"> Again, he sollicits in Manner most nice,</l><l n="76" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-76"> By another more subtle and cunning Device,</l><l n="77" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-77"> Because he has heard that his Patron's well read,</l><l n="78" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-78"> He lays by his Belly and begs for his Head;</l><l n="79" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-79"> For writing three Riddles had cost him such Pains,</l><l n="80" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-80"> That he scarce had remaining three Scruples of Brains,</l><l n="81" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-81"> For want of some Money he's quite off the Hooks,</l><l n="82" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-82"> To pay off old Scores and to buy him new Books,</l><l n="83" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-83"> To rebuild a House that he pull'd down already,</l><l n="84" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-84"> And to buy a fine Ribband to give a fine Lady.</l><l n="85" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-85"> These are but a few, that I chose from the rest,</l><l n="86" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-86"> Tho' not one Thought in it but can stand the Test.</l><l n="87" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-87"> Nay more I will venture to swear it surpasses,</l><l n="88" xml:id="spp-S17530FC-line-88"> All Poems that ever were hatch'd at <hi
