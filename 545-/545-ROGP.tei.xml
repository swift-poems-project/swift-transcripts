It seems the Dean, in conversation with some friends, said, he could guess the discourse of the world concerning his character after his death, and thought it might be no improper subject for a poem. This happened above a year before he finished it; for it was written by small pieces, just as leisure or humour allowed him. He showed some parts of it to several friends, and when it was completed, he seldom refused the sight of it to any visitor: so that, probably, it has been perused by fifty persons; which, being against his usual practice, many people judged, likely enough, that he had a desire to make the people of Dublin impatient to see it published, and at the same time resolved to disappoint them; for, he would never be prevailed on to grant a copy, and yet several lines were retained by memory, and are often repeated in Dublin. It is thought, that one of his servants in whom he had great confidence, and who had access to his closet, took an opportunity, while his master was riding some miles out of town, to transcribe the whole poem: and it is probable, that the servant lent it to others, who were not trusty (as it is generally the case). By this accident, I, having got a very correct copy from a friend in Dublin, lie under no obligation to conceal it. I have shown it to very good judges, and friends of the Dean, (if I may venture to say so to you, who are such a superior judge and poet), who are well acquainted with the author's style and manner, and they all allow it to be genuine, as well as perfectly finished and correct; his particular genius appearing in every line, together with his peculiar way of thinking and writing. I should be very sorry to offend the Dean, although I am a perfect stranger to his person: but since the poem will infallibly be soon printed, either here, or in Dublin, I take myself to have the best title to send it to the press; and I shall direct the printer to commit as few errors as possible. I am, sir, with the greatest respect, Your most obedient and humble servant, L.M.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="6" xml:id="spp-545-ROGP-headnote-6"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-545-ROGP-headnote-6-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-545-ROGP-headnote-6-line-group-1-line-1">From my chambers in the Inner Temple, London.
