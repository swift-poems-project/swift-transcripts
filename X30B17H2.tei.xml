VI. part ii. p. 169.), and challenging Dr. <hi rend="underline">Helsham</hi> to exceed him by returning fourteen more (thirty-four in all); which Dr. <hi rend="underline">Helsham</hi> accordingly here performs.──These are some of the puerilities for which the Dean has since been severely censured; but the foibles of such a writer as Dr. <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi> are amusing, even in the few instances where they are not instructive.
