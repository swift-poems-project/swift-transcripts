The Dean, the Doctor, another Gentleman, and the Bishop of Meath, once set out together from Dublin, to pass some days at a friends house in the country. The Bishop had said that he should not be able to visit his diocese for some time, as his house was rebuilding; upon which Swift made him a tender of his house at Laracor, till his own should be ready for him. The discourse naturally fell upon country seats; and Sheridan enlarged a good deal upon the beauties of Quilca; which though at that time in a very rude state, to use a modern phrase, had certainly great capabilities. Swift exclaimed, my Lord, do you hear that vapouring scab? I will shew you an exact picture of that place which he has painted in such fine colours. Upon which he put his hand in his pocket, and, for the first time, produced that ludicrous copy of verses on Quilea, since printed in his Works. This occasioned a good deal of laughter at the Doctor's expence, who bore it patiently for some time, but meditated speedy revenge. He then pretended to be weary of the coach, and said he would mount his horse, which was led, and go before to prepare breakfast for them at the inn. He made what speed he could, and upon his arrival there, instantly called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote the Poem, describing the Dean's goods at Laracor. Upon seeing a beggar at the door, the thought struck him to have this presented to the Bishop by way of petition. He accordingly folded it up in that form, and gave the beggar his lesson when and how he was to present it. When breakfast was over, and they had all got into the coach, the beggar with much importunity, stretched his hand out with the petition to the Bishop. Swift, always at enmity with these vagrants, begged of his Lordship not to receive it, and was calling out to the coachman to drive on, when the Bishop, who had been let into the secret by Sheridan, stopped him, and opening the petition, kept it close to his eyes, so that no one else might see its contents, and for some time seemed to read it with attention. He then gave the poor man a shilling, and said he would examine into the truth of what was there set down, when he returned. Swift for a long time after indulged himself on his usual topic, inveighing strongly against giving encouragement to such sturdy vagabonds, who were the pests of society, <hi rend="underline">&amp;c. &amp;c</hi>. The Bishop at last interrupting him said, “Indeed, Mr. Dean, if what is here set forth to be true, the man is a real object of compassion as you shall see.” Upon which he read aloud the following contents of the paper.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="2" xml:id="spp-X44-01S1-headnote-2"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-X44-01S1-headnote-2-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-X44-01S1-headnote-2-line-group-1-line-1">Thus were the tables turned upon the Dean, and a good deal of mirth indulged at his expence.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="3" xml:id="spp-X44-01S1-headnote-3"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-X44-01S1-headnote-3-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-X44-01S1-headnote-3-line-group-1-line-1"/></lg></head>
