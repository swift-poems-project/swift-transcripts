It is also believed, that he hath composed others occasionally for the amusement of himself and a few intimate friends; which, by the indiscretion of others, were, from stolen and uncorrected copies, <hi rend="underline">dragged into light</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="3" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-3"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-3-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-3-line-group-1-line-1">But I hold it for certain, that a much greater number have, by the boldness of Printers, and the want of judgement in Readers, been charged upon that Author, wherein he never had the smallest finger, as I am assured he hath often declared; and, which is remarkable, was as free in disowning some writings charged upon him, of which he had no reason to be ashamed, as he could be of the meanest productions of <hi rend="underline">Hibernian</hi> Grubstreet.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="4" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-4"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-4-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-4-line-group-1-line-1">As to those <hi rend="underline">fatal Verses</hi>, called the Lady's Dressing Room, which have so highly inflamed the whole sex (except a very few of better judgement), as I can by no means justify the vulgar opinion, that seemeth to fix it upon a person so well known for works of a very different nature; so I cannot but lament the prevailing ill taste among us, which is not able to discover that useful satire running through every line; and the matter is as decently wrapped up as it is possible the subject could bear.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="5" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-5"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-5-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-5-line-group-1-line-1"><hi rend="underline">Cleanliness</hi> hath, in all polite ages and nations, been esteemed the chief corporal perfection in Women; as it is well known to those who are conversant with the ancient Poets. And so it is still among the young people of judgement and sobriety, when they are disposed to marry. And I do not doubt but that there is a great number of young ladies in this town and kingdom, who, in reading that Poem, find great complacency in their own minds, from a consciousness, that the satirical part in the Lady's Dressing-Room doth not in the least affect them.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="6" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-6"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-6-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-6-line-group-1-line-1">Wherefore it is manifest, that no Poem was ever written with a better design for the service of the <hi rend="underline">sex</hi>: wherein our Author hath observed, to a tittle, the precepts of his Master <hi rend="underline">Horace</hi>; or, indeed, rather hath gone very far beyond him in the article of <hi rend="underline">decency</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="7" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-7"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-7-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-7-line-group-1-line-1">That great poet, instructing us what actions are fittest to be produced only upon the Scene, and which are most proper to be only related to the Audience, goeth many lengths beyond the Author of the Lady's Dressing-Room; for at the same instant when he sayeth some actions should not appear as done upon the stage, he allows they may be <hi rend="underline">recited</hi> with the pleasure and <hi rend="underline">elegance</hi>; and yet, when he cometh to particulars, his recital is extremely gross, and so are his very <hi rend="underline">precepts</hi> which forbid the actions: that, if our infinitely more modest Author had imitated his Master's <hi rend="underline">style</hi>, the whole world might, with great appearance of reason, have been up in arms against him.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="8" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-8"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-8-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-8-line-group-1-line-1">Therefore, to set these two Poets in a true light, I have ventured, for the satisfaction of both sexes, to translate, as literally as I could, ten lines in <hi rend="underline">Horace</hi>, upon the very subject, which our Author hath handled with a decency so far superior to his <hi rend="underline">Roman</hi> Master.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="9" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-9"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-9-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-9-line-group-1-line-1">To justify the truth of my translation, I desire all fine Gentlemen and Ladies will appeal from me to the information of the Learned, that I may be wholly clear from the last censure of misrepresenting so great an authority; for, indeed, if I have been guilty of any fault, it is in palliating the gross expressions in the original, and softening them very much to the <hi rend="underline">politeness</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">present age</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="10" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-10"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-10-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-10-line-group-1-line-1">The <hi rend="underline">Latin</hi> is word for word as follows:</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="11" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-11"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-11-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01072H1-headnote-11-line-group-1-line-1"><hi rend="underline">Aut agitur res in scenis, aut acta refertur. <lb/> Segniùs irritant animos demissa per aurem, <lb/> Quam qu/ae/ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, &amp; qu/ae/ <lb/> Ipse sibi tradit spectator.
