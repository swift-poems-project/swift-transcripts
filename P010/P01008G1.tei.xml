And so it is still among the young people of judgment and sobriety, when they are disposed to marry. And I do not doubt, but that there is a great number of young ladies in this town and kingdom, who, in reading that poem, find great complacency in their own minds, from a consciousness, that the satirical part in the <hi rend="underline">Lady's dressing-room</hi> doth not in the least affect them.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="8" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-8"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-8-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-8-line-group-1-line-1">Wherefore it is manifest, that no <hi rend="underline">poem</hi> was ever written with a better design for the service of the <hi rend="underline">sex</hi>: wherein our <hi rend="underline">author</hi> hath observed, to a tittle, the precepts of his master Horace; or, indeed, rather hath gone very far beyond him, in the article of <hi rend="underline">decency</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="9" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-9"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-9-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-9-line-group-1-line-1">That great <hi rend="underline">poet</hi>, instructing us what actions are fittest to be produced openly upon the <hi rend="underline">scene</hi>, and which are most proper to be only related to the audience, goeth many lengths beyond the <hi rend="underline">author</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">Lady's dressing-room</hi>; for, at the same instant when he saith, some actions should not appear as done upon the stage, he allows, they may be <hi rend="underline">recited</hi> with pleasure and <hi rend="underline">elegance</hi>; and yet when he cometh to particulars, his recital is extremely gross, and so are his very <hi rend="underline">precepts</hi> which forbid the actions: that if our infinitely more modest <hi rend="underline">author</hi> had imitated his <hi rend="underline">master's style</hi>, the whole world might, with great appearance of reason, have been up in arms against him.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="10" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-10"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-10-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-10-line-group-1-line-1">Therefore to set these two <hi rend="underline">poets</hi> in a true light, I have ventured, for the satisfaction of both sexes, to translate, as literally as I could, ten lines in Horace, upon the very same subject, which our <hi rend="underline">author</hi> hath handled with a decency so far superior to his Roman master.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="11" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-11"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-11-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-11-line-group-1-line-1">To justify the truth of my translation, I desire all fine gentlemen and ladies will appeal from me to the information of the learned, that I may be wholly clear from the least censure of misrepresenting so great an authority; for, indeed, if I have been guilty of any fault, it is in palliating the gross expressions in the original, and softening them very much to the <hi rend="underline">politeness</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">present age</hi>.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="12" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-12"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-12-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-P01008G1-headnote-12-line-group-1-line-1">The Latin is word for word as follows:<hi rend="underline">Aut agitur res in scenis, aut acta refertur.Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,Quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quæIpse sibi tradit spectator.

Horace, on the contrary, plainly calleth a <hi rend="underline">spade</hi>, a <hi rend="underline">spade</hi>, when there was not the least necessity; and when, with equal ease, as well as significancy, he might have expressed his meaning in homely terms, fit for the nicest ears of a <hi rend="underline">queen</hi> or a <hi rend="underline">duchess</hi>.P01008G1   HN15 I do therefore positively decide in favour of our Hibernian <hi rend="underline">bard</hi>, upon the article of <hi rend="underline">decency</hi>; and am ready to defend my proposition against all mankind; that, in the ten lines of Horace, here faithfully and favourably translated, there are ten times more <hi rend="underline">slovenly expressions</hi>, than in the whole <hi rend="underline">poem</hi> called <hi rend="underline">The Lady's dressing-room</hi>; and for the truth of this proposition, I am ready to appeal to all the young ladies of the kingdom, or to such a <hi rend="underline">committee</hi> as my very adversaries shall appoint.P01008G1   </l></lg></div>
