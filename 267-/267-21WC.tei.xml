here on the Eleventh,</l><l n="3" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-3"> Convened by Apollo, who gave 'em to know,</l><l n="4" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-4"> He'd have a Vicegerent in his Empire below;</l><l n="5" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-5"> But declared that no Bard shou'd this Honour inherit,</l><l n="6" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-6"> Till the rest had agreed he surpass'd them in Merit:</l><l n="7" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-7"> Now this you'll allow was a difficult Case,</l><l n="8" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-8"> For each Bard believ'd he had a Right to the Place;</l><l n="9" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-9"> So finding th' Assembly grow warm in Debate,</l><l n="10" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-10"> He put 'em in Mind of his Phaeton's Fate;</l><l n="11" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-11"> 'Twas urg'd to no Purpose, the Dispute higher rose,</l><l n="12" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-12"> Scarce Ph<unclear>oe</unclear>bus himself cou'd their Quarrels compose.</l><l n="13" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-13"> Till at length he determin'd that every Bard,</l><l n="14" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-14"> Shou'd each in their Turn be patiently heard.First one who believ'd he excell'd in Translation,</l><l n="15" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-15"> Founds his Claim on the Doctrine of Transmigration:</l><l n="16" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-16"> `Since the Soul of

this Fool?</l><l n="19" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-19"> I am Just come from Reading Pythagoras at School.</l><l n="20" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-20"> Be gone, Sir, you've got your Subscriptions in time,</l><l n="21" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-21"> And giv'n in Return neither Reason nor Rhyme.To the next says the God, tho' now I won't chuse you:</l><l n="22" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-22"> I'll tell you the Reason for which I refuse you,</l><l n="23" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-23"> Love's Goodness has oft to her Parent complain'd,</l><l n="24" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-24"> Of my fav'ring a

Judgment and Wit.</l><l n="27" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-27"> That to make you a Laureat I give the first Voice,</l><l n="28" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-28"> Inspiring the Britons I approve of my Choice.</l><l n="29" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-29"> Jove sent her to me her Power to try,</l><l n="30" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-30"> The Goddess of Beauty what God can deny?</l><l n="31"

had good Hopes of succeeding,</l><l n="33" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-33"> For he merited much for his Wit and his Breeding.</l><l n="34" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-34"> 'Twas wise in the Britons no Favour to shew him,</l><l n="35" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-35"> He else might expect they shou'd pay what they owe him:</l><l n="36" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-36"> And therefore they prudently chose to discard,</l><l n="37" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-37"> The Patriot, whose Merits they wou'd not reward;</l><l n="38" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-38"> The God with a Smile bid his Fav'rite advance,</l><l n="39" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-39"> You were sent by Astr<unclear>ae</unclear>a her Envoy to France.</l><l n="40" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-40"> You bent your Ambition to rise in the State,</l><l n="41" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-41"> I refuse you because you cou'd stoop to be great.Then a Bard who had been a successful Translator,`The Convention allows me a Versificator.Says Apollo you mention the least of your Merit,</l><l n="42" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-42"> By your Works it appears you have much of my Spirit;</l><l n="43" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-43"> I esteem you so well that to tell you the Truth,</l><l n="44" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-44"> The greatest Objection against you's your Youth;</l><l n="45" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-45"> Then he not concern'd you're now laid aside,</l><l n="46" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-46"> If you have you shall certainly one day preside.Another, low bending, Apollo thus greets,`'Twas I taught your Subject, to walk thro' the Streets.</l><l n="47" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-47"> You taught 'em to walk, why they knew it before,</l><l n="48" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-48"> But give me the Bard that can teach 'em to roar,</l><l n="49" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-49"> Whenever he claims his Right I'll confess</l><l n="50" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-50"> Who lately attempted my Style with Success,</l><l n="51" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-51"> Who writes like Apollo has most of his Spirit,</l><l n="52" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-52"> And therefore 'tis just, I distinguish his Merit,</l><l n="53" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-53"> Who makes it appear by all he has writ,</l><l n="54" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-54"> His Judgment alone can set Bounds to his Wit,</l><l n="55" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-55"> Like Virgil correct, with his own Native Ease,</l><l n="56" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-56"> But excess ev'n Virgil in elegant Praise.</l><l n="57" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-57"> Who admires the Ancients, and knows 'tis their due,</l><l n="58" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-58"> Yet write in a Manner entirely New.</l><l n="59" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-59"> Tho' none with more Ease their Depths can explore,</l><l n="60" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-60"> Yet whatever he wants he takes from my Store,</l><l n="61" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-61"> Tho I'm fond of his Virtues his Pride I can see,</l><l n="62" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-62"> In fearing to borrow from any but me,</l><l n="63" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-63"> 'Tis owing to this like Cynthia his Lays</l><l n="64" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-64"> Enlighten the World by reflecting my Rays,</l><l n="65" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-65"> This said, the whole Audience soon found out his Drift</l><l n="66" xml:id="spp-267-21WC-line-66"> The Convention was summon'd in Favour of Sw────ft.267-21WC
