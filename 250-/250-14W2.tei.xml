The parliamentary proceedings instituted against them were carried on with unusual violence.

They were compelled to deliver, upon oath, the strictest value of their estates, and were disabled from making any transfer or alienation of any part of their property. Against a bill of pains and penalties, it is the common right of every subject to be heard by his counsel at the bar: they prayed to be heard; their prayer was refused; and their oppressors, who required no evidence, would listen to no defence. It had been at first proposed, that one-eighth of their respective estates should be allowed for the future support of the directors; but it was speciously urged, that, in the various shades of opulence and guilt, such a proportion would be too light for many, and for some might possibly be too heavy. All were condemned, absent and unheard, in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which swept away the greater part of their substance.”──G<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">IBBON</hi>'s <hi rend="underline">Miscellaneous Works</hi>, vol.
