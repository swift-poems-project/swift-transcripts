But, when the lenient Hand of Time had allayed the Anguish of his Mind, he seems to have regretted the Effects of its first Violence, <ref target="#spp-673A1171-footnote-1">1</ref><note n="1" xml:id="spp-673A1171-footnote-1" place="foot"><hi rend="underline">D.

In the Year 1732, he complains in a Letter to Mr. <hi rend="underline">Gay</hi>, that he had a large House, and should hardly find one Visitor, if he was not able to hire them with a Bottle of Wine. I generally, says he, dine alone, and, am thankful, if a Friend will pass the Evening with me. He complains also about the same Time, in a Letter to Mr. <hi rend="underline">Pope</hi>, that he was in danger of dying poor and <hi rend="underline">friendless</hi>, even his Female Friends having forsaken him; which, as he says, was what vexed him most. These Complaints were afterwards repeated in a Strain of yet greater Sensibility and Self-pity: All my Friends, says he, have forsaken me.</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="2" xml:id="spp-673A1171-headnote-2"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-673A1171-headnote-2-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-673A1171-headnote-2-line-group-1-line-1"/></lg></head><head type="note" n="3" xml:id="spp-673A1171-headnote-3"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-673A1171-headnote-3-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-673A1171-headnote-3-line-group-1-line-1"/></lg></head>
