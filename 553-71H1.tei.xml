      <lg n="1" type="stanza"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-line-1"> P. 291. The “Verses on the Death of Dr. <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi>” have undergone, perhaps, a stranger revolution than any other part of his writings. A manifestly spurious copy, containing 201 lines, under the title of “The Life and Character of Dr. <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi>,” appeared at <hi rend="underline">London</hi>, in <hi rend="underline">April</hi> 1733 <ref target="#spp-553-71H1-footnote-1">1</ref><note place="foot" n="1" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-footnote-1">Besides the improbability of the Dean's permitting a poem in every respect unworthy of him to appear in public, when he had a copy so much superior in his own hands; the story which Mrs. <hi rend="underline">Pilkington</hi> puts together on this occasion (vol. I. p. 134.) may be deemed a proof of the imposture. That ingenious lady acknowledges she was favoured with the perusal of the original for a single night, under an injunction of transcribing no part of it; but that her memory enabled her to repeat the whole. It is very probable that she may have had a sight of it; which was sufficient to enable a person of her versatile abilities to form a faint resemblance; and that her husband, who came to <hi rend="underline">London</hi> but a few months before, was the publisher. Yet she would modestly persuade us, that Dr. <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi> had purposely burlesqued his own style, and made use of <hi rend="underline">triples</hi> and <hi rend="underline">dahses</hi>, the better to disguise it; and Lord <hi rend="underline">Orrery</hi> implicitly gave credit to her assertion.</note>: of which the Dean complained heavily, in a Letter to Mr. <hi rend="underline">Pope</hi>, dated <hi rend="underline">May</hi> 1; and, notwithstanding <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi> acknowledged in that Letter he had written “a poem of near five hundred lines upon the same maxim of <hi rend="underline">Rochefoucault</hi>, and was a long time about it,” many Readers have supposed (not attending to the circumstance of there being <hi rend="underline">two</hi> poems on the subject) that the Dean hath disclaimed the <hi rend="underline">Verses on his own Death</hi>; and, in fact, the poem printed under that title in vol. VI. is not agreeable to the Author's copy, as will appear from several Letters of Dr. <hi rend="underline">King</hi> (then principal of <hi rend="underline">St. Mary's Hall, Oxford</hi>); in vol. XXIII. The genuine verses having been committed to the care of the celebrated Author of “The Toast;” an edition was printed, in 1738-9, in which more than an hundred lines were omitted. Dr. <hi rend="underline">King</hi> assigned many judicious reasons (though some of them were merely temporary and prudential) for the mutilations: but they were so far from satisfying Dr. <hi rend="underline">Swift</hi>, that a compleat edition was immediately printed by <hi rend="underline">Faulkner</hi>, with the Dean's express permission. The poem, as it now stands in this collection, is agreeable to Dr. <hi rend="underline">King's</hi> copy; but, as the <hi rend="underline">variations</hi> from the original are not pointed out, it is our duty to supply that deficiency.<gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/></l><l n="2" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-line-2"> P.·292.·<hi rend="underline">After·line·</hi>2<hi rend="underline">,·add</hi>,</l></lg><lg n="2" type="stanza"><l n="3" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-line-3">Who would not, at a crowded shew,&#13;Stand high himself, keep others low?<gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/></l><l n="4" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-line-4"> P.·296.·l.·25.·He would send <hi rend="underline">many a message</hi>·is·right:·but·the·question·<hi rend="underline">how</hi>,·seems·to·destroy·the·unity·or·collective·nature·of·the·idea;·and·therefore·it·ought·to·have·been·expressed,·if·the·measure·would·have·allowed·it,·without·the·articles,·in·the·plural·number,·<hi rend="underline">how·many·messages</hi>.·L<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">OWTH</hi>.<gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/><gap/></l><l n="5" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-line-5"> P.·298.·<hi rend="underline">Fill·up·the·blank·lines·thus</hi>;</l></lg><lg n="3" type="stanza"><l n="6" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-line-6">He's dead, you say; then let him rot;&#13;I'm glad the <hi rend="underline">medals</hi><ref target="#spp-553-71H1-footnote-2">2</ref><note place="foot" n="2" xml:id="spp-553-71H1-footnote-2">They were to be sent in four months but * * * * * *──See vol.

From the free-school in that town, he was removed to that of <hi rend="underline">Okeham</hi>, where he became proficient in the graces of poetry. At the age of 17, he was entered of <hi rend="underline">St. John's College, Cambridge</hi>; and, after taking the degree of bachelor of arts, became master of <hi rend="underline">Melton</hi> school; was ordained deacon by bishop <hi rend="underline">Wake</hi>, and priest by bishop <hi rend="underline">Gibson</hi>, and began his “Universal Grammar.” Resigning the school, he came to <hi rend="underline">London</hi>, strongly recommended by the most considerable persons in his native country; had a benefice given him by the earl of <hi rend="underline">Macclesfield</hi>, was appointed chaplain to lord <hi rend="underline">Molesworth</hi>, had a lecture in the city, was an assistant to Dr. <hi rend="underline">Burscough</hi> afterward bishop of <hi rend="underline">Limerick</hi>, and became a popular preacher. He published, among other pieces, a translation of <hi rend="underline">Pliny's</hi> Epistles, 2 vols. 8vo. 1714; of several works of <hi rend="underline">Vertot</hi>; of <hi rend="underline">Montfaucon's Italian</hi> Travels, &amp;c.
