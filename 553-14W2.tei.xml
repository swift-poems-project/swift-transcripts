A manifestly spurious copy, containing 201 lines, under the title of “The Life and Character of Dr S<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">WIFT</hi>,” appeared at London, in April 1733; of which the Dean complained heavily, in a letter to Mr Pope, dated May 1st; and notwithstanding Swift acknowledged in that letter he had written “a poem of near 500 lines upon the same maxim of Rochefoucault, and was a long time about it,” many readers have supposed (not attending to the circumstances of there being <hi rend="underline">two</hi> poems on the subject) that the Dean disclaimed the <hi rend="underline">Verses on his own Death</hi>. The genuine verses having been committed to the care of the celebrated author of “The Toast,” an edition was printed in 1738-9, in which more than 100 lines were omitted. Dr King assigned many judicious reasons (though some of them were merely temporary and prudential) for the mutilations: but they were so far from satisfying Dr Swift, that a complete edition was immediately printed by Faulkner, with the Dean's express permission. The poem, as it now stands in this collection, is agreeable to Mr Faulkner's copy.──N<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">ICOL</hi></note></l></lg></head><head type="note" n="2" xml:id="spp-553-14W2-headnote-2"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-553-14W2-headnote-2-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-553-14W2-headnote-2-line-group-1-line-1">Occasioned by reading the folowing M<hi rend="SMALL-CAPS">AXIM</hi> in ROCHEFOUCAULT, “Dans l'adversité de nos meilleurs amis, nous trouvons toujours quelque chose, qui ne nous déplaît pas.”</l></lg></head><head type="note" n="3" xml:id="spp-553-14W2-headnote-3"><lg n="1" xml:id="spp-553-14W2-headnote-3-line-group-1" type="headnote"><l n="1" xml:id="spp-553-14W2-headnote-3-line-group-1-line-1">“In the adversity of our best friends, we always find something that does not displease us.”</l></lg></head>
